## 🎮 - About Me

Hi! My name is **Natan Bagatoli**. Since I was young, I’ve always been curious about how things work, especially when it comes to technology. 

💡 That curiosity led me to pursue a degree in **Analysis and Systems Development** at SENAI/SC, where I learned to turn ideas into functional solutions.<br>

🎉Today, at 21, I work as a **Freelance Web Developer**, building websites and creating digital experiences that connect people and solve real problems. Along the way, I discovered a passion for Machine Learning, a field that challenges me to think differently and constantly learn.<br>

🎨 When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading a good book, which helps me see the world from new perspectives. For me, every project is a chance to grow, and I’m always ready for the next challenge.
